            For the 2d-convolution operation used frequently in image 
            recognition, we can convert it into a matrix multiplication by
            duplicating the data in input/weight matrices in a specific way. 
            Although the duplication makes the cache hierarchy less useful, 
            since a cache miss might not have occurred if the mapping function 
            was slightly different. We partition the L2 cache into "unique"
            and "normal" parts and use a new mapping function that minimizes 
            duplicated values in the unique section if the passed address is 
            within the bounds of the lowered matrix.

            Expands on previous work to use supercells from density functional 
            theory to represent the defect crystal input to a graph neural 
            network. Each crystal material is normally represented as a 
            non-repeating "unit cell" with each atom as a node and each bond as 
            an edge, while <i>supercells</i> contain repetitions of unit cells 
            that are connected to each other with a pooling function that 
            collates the nodes from different repeated instances. Uses transfer 
            learning to support a much larger graph, avoiding a problem other
            work faced when trying to increase model size with such a small
            dataset.

            Showed how transfer learning could be utilized to improve the
            performance of a graph neural network pretrained on pristine 
            crystal structures and post-trained to predict the formation 
            energies of defected crystal structures. The defect dataset is very 
            small while the pristine dataset is comparatively a lot larger, so 
            transfer learning was shown to improve the performance by a small 
            amount. Worked with two undergraduate students during UNT's Summer 
            2024 Artificial Intelligence REU.
